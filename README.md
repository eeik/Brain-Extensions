# Brain-Extensions
A few augmentative ideas for expanding capabilities of TheBrain ðŸ§ 


## Logfile Parsing, Storage, and Visualization w/ Elastic Stack
* parse TheBrain logfiles
* output to Elasticsearch
* Kibana scripted fields to unlock insights into logfile data
* Kibana search queries to build custom dashboards atop for historical review

## Django App for interrogating and visualizing TheBrain w/ logfile historical overlay
* R/O connection to TheBrain database for real-time state insights
* dynamically rendered Kibana search filters for historical context
    - think *rich personal history* for the ongoing *use* of TheBrain
* full capabilities of Python for
    - script integration and process automation
    - AI based review of TheBrain context/graph to pre-fetch/search suggestions
    - *example:* download image, crop to dimensions, search and extract image features, save locally (not TheBrain's DB), and visualize output in some sort of novel way
